## ðŸ¤” Who am I?
My name is Soryn BÃ¤chli and I currently live in Switzerland and pursuing my developer career!
At the moment I have an apprenticeship at Siemens, but also create alot of other projects & try to contribute to many others!

I also play video games, produce/listen music & draw pixel art in my free-time!

<br>

## ðŸ”­ What I'm currently working on
I'm currently working on a rather bigger Vue project called ["Critterpedia"](https://github.com/Soryyyn/Critterpedia "My Critterpedia Repository"). If you played the new Animal Crossing game, you know what it is about, if you haven't it is a list of your currently catched animals. If this project goes "viral" (alot of registered users), I would enjoy every sponsor I would get, to maintain this project!

## ðŸŒ± What I'm currently learning
Currently I'm doing alot of my projects with Vue.js & Typescript, but I'm trying to learn Rust too. I have experience in Java, C, C#, Javascript/Typescript, SQL and a bit of Rust and PHP.

I also like to explore linux and more abstract topics!
